    <ul>
        <li>To create a secure and reliable platform for online interviews and coursework submissions.</li>
        <li>To minimize cheating by implementing AI-generated questions, video responses, and gaze tracking technology.</li>
        <li>To provide a seamless user experience with an easy-to-use interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>AI-Generated Questions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilizing Chat GPT, we generate dynamic and challenging questions for students to explain their work.</li>
                <li>Questions are presented one by one, ensuring a focused response and reducing the likelihood of cheating.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Video Responses:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Students respond to questions through video submissions, adding an extra layer of authenticity.</li>
                <li>Arbitrary time limits, determined by question difficulty, discourage the use of external aids.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gaze Tracking Technology:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Integration of an ML model for eye tracking to monitor pupil position during video responses.</li>
                <li>Analysis of relative pupil position helps identify suspicious behavior, such as looking away or frequent distractions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong>
            <ul>
